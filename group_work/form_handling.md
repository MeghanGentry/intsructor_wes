# Flask Form Handling
## Questions to answer
    - Why do we use forms?
    - What kind of request do we typically send when we submit a form? Why?
    - How do we access user inputted information from a form?
    - How do we allow a user to use a form?
    - How is the form the user sees and the information we receive related?
    - Why do we normally use 2 separate routes when dealing with just one form?
        - What are the drawbacks to having just one?
    - How does the request/response cycle fit into the bigger picture?
    - What are validations? How do we implement them?

## Group should be able to
    - Display a form to a user.
    - Access form information inputted by the user.
    - Build a success page that can be accessed using the URL bar that displays information previously inputted by a user, without the server breaking.
        - This can be done with session or a db.
